## TODO List


1. Testing functionality
    1. compare with opencv orb on multiple image. Write a compare.cc under example/ and test detected keypoints with multiple images (in door, outdoor, low light, high light, matching) @Jack @4.11
    2. compare with brisk (the uk package & opencv package) on multiple image. same setting as above. Also considered matching @Jack @4.11
    3. run our ORB inside okvis, validate algorithm work, compare with previous okvis result (feature detected, tracking accuracy in different condition) NOTE: may need to figure out the vocabulary part @Nianxu @4.11
    4. run our ORB inside OpenARK. Same comparision above. @Nianxu @4.11
